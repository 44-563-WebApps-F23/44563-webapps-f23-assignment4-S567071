    <h3>An Enemy of the People - <i>Henric Ibsen</i></h3>
        <h6>Dr. Stockmann.</h6>
        <p>Let me see it.<p>[Opens and reads it.] </p> Ah!—of course.</p>

        <h6>Mrs. Stockmann.</h6> <p>Who is it from?</p>

        <h6>Dr. Stockmann.</h6> <p>From the landlord. Notice to quit.</p>

        <h6>Mrs. Stockmann.</h6> <p>Is it possible? Such a nice man</p>

        <h6>Dr. Stockmann</h6> <p>[looking at the letter].<p>Does not dare do otherwise, he
        says. Doesn't like doing it, but dare not do otherwise—on account of
        his fellow-citizens—out of regard for public opinion. Is in a
        dependent position—dares not offend certain influential men.</p>

        <h6>Mrs. Stockmann.</h6> <p>There, you see, Thomas!</p>

        <h6>Dr. Stockmann.</h6> <p>Yes, yes, I see well enough; the whole lot of them in
        the town are cowards; not a man among them dares do anything for fear
        of the others.<p>[Throws the letter on to the table.]</p> But it doesn't
        matter to us, Katherine. We are going to sail away to the New World,
        and—</p>

        <h6>Mrs. Stockmann.</h6> <p>But, Thomas, are you sure we are well advised to take
        this step?</p>

        <h6>Dr. Stockmann.</h6> <p>Are you suggesting that I should stay here, where they
        have pilloried me as an enemy of the people—branded me—broken my
        windows! And just look here, Katherine—they have torn a great rent in
        my black trousers too!</p>

        <h6>Mrs. Stockmann.</h6> <p>Oh, dear!—and they are the best pair you have got!</p>
