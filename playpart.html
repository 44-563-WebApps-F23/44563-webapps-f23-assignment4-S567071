        have pilloried me as an enemy of the people—branded me—broken my
        windows! And just look here, Katherine—they have torn a great rent in
        my black trousers too!</p>

        <h6 class="MrsStockmann">Mrs. Stockmann.</h6> <p class="speech">Oh, dear!—and they are the best pair you have got!</p>
