        Dr. Stockmann. Let me see it. (Opens and reads it.) Ah!—of course.

        Mrs. Stockmann. Who is it from?

        Dr. Stockmann. From the landlord. Notice to quit.

        Mrs. Stockmann. Is it possible? Such a nice man

        Dr. Stockmann (looking at the letter). Does not dare do otherwise, he
        says. Doesn't like doing it, but dare not do otherwise—on account of
        his fellow-citizens—out of regard for public opinion. Is in a
        dependent position—dares not offend certain influential men.

        Mrs. Stockmann. There, you see, Thomas!

        Dr. Stockmann. Yes, yes, I see well enough; the whole lot of them in
        the town are cowards; not a man among them dares do anything for fear
        of the others. (Throws the letter on to the table.) But it doesn't
        matter to us, Katherine. We are going to sail away to the New World,
        and—

        Mrs. Stockmann. But, Thomas, are you sure we are well advised to take
        this step?

        Dr. Stockmann. Are you suggesting that I should stay here, where they
        have pilloried me as an enemy of the people—branded me—broken my
        windows! And just look here, Katherine—they have torn a great rent in
        my black trousers too!

        Mrs. Stockmann. Oh, dear!—and they are the best pair you have got!
