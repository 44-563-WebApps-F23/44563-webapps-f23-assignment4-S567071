    <h3>An Enemy of the people - <i>Henric Ibsen</i></h3>
    <h6 class="Stockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6> <p class="speech">You should never wear your best trousers when you go out
    to fight for freedom and truth. It is not that I care so much about the
    trousers, you know; you can always sew them up again for me. But that
    the common herd should dare to make this attack on me, as if they were
    my equals—that is what I cannot, for the life of me, swallow!</p>

    <h6 class="MrsStockmann">Mrs. Stockmann.</h6><p class="speech">There is no doubt they have behaved very ill toward
    you, Thomas; but is that sufficient reason for our leaving our native
    country for good and all?</p>

    <h6 class="Stockmann">Dr. Stockmann.</h6> <p class="speech">If we went to another town, do you suppose we should not
    find the common people just as insolent as they are here? Depend upon
    it, there is not much to choose between them. Oh, well, let the curs
    snap—that is not the worst part of it. The worst is that, from one end
    of this country to the other, every man is the slave of his Party.
    Although, as far as that goes, I daresay it is not much better in the
    free West either; the compact majority, and liberal public opinion, and
    all that infernal old bag of tricks are probably rampant there too. But
    there things are done on a larger scale, you see. They may kill you,
    but they won't put you to death by slow torture. They don't squeeze a
    free man's soul in a vice, as they do here. And, if need be, one can
    live in solitude. <p class="direction">[Walks up and down.]</p> <p class="speech">If only I knew where there was a
    virgin forest or a small South Sea island for sale, cheap—</p>
